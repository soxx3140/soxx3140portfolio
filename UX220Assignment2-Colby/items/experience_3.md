2. It was when I was having a semester break and decided to join the vacation with my parents.

##### What was good about it?
3. It was a good learning activity and exercise that did not involve much movement, but more to do with your precision and eye coordiantion skills.

##### What was your favorite memory of it?
4. Making decent scores with a simple posture and instructions, giving a sense of fun.

##### What didn't you enjoy about it?
5. The only thing I probably did not like about it was that it made my arms sore afterwards. 

##### Give your experience a letter "grade"
