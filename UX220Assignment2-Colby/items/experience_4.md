## Learning to Code using different scripts 

##### What was it that you did? 
1. I learned to code from various scripts out there ranging from Javascript to CSS

##### When did you do it? 
2. I started learning more about the ins and outs of programming and coding when I started high school

##### What was good about it? 
3. To me, it was an interesting way to see how your efforts are being shown directly in real time as part of the progression slope. 

##### What was your favourite memory of it? 
4. My favorite memory from it were being a good motivator and sense of accomplishment for me whenever something works from my trial and error, with a good guide as a reference.

##### What didn't you enjoy about it? 
5. What I did not enjoy about learning coding is reading them from textbooks without a step to step guide or extras that I could implement to the existing code as they in no way
makes it easy to grasp the concept or make it work. 

##### Give your experience a letter "grade"
6. I personally would give it a grading of "B". It was definitely an experience that I enjoyed without being too overwhelmed and something I felt I can do better as long there is 
a good easy to follow and also have direct assistance from people for, my lecturer for instance.
