## Learing to draw and paint 

##### What was it that you did? 
1. I learned to draw the portraits and then paint them using the brush and color palettes. 

##### When did you do it? 
2. I started taking the art classes when I was still in primary school during my free time.

##### What was good about it? 
3. I learned how to draw and paint, even if they were basic since they also proved useful learning experience for initial sketches that I currently do for university projects.

##### What was your favourite memory of it? 
4. My favorite memory of it was being able to draw, color and then sense of accomplishment as I learned to draw and color at harder levels, as self-satisfaction of my own efforts. 

##### What didn't you enjoy about it? 
5. I would say my reasons for not enjoying it is the same as why I didn't like to play the piano when I was younger, lack of patience and understanding what makes them appealing
in their own way.

##### Give your experience a letter "grade"
6. I would give it a grade of "C". As mentioned above, it was something that went alright for me, considering my circumstances were quite different back then unlike today.
